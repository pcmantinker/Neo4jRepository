# Neo4jRepository
This is a generic repository with a Neo4j implementation built on Neo4jClient. You can easily build up generic repositories that can be used for CRUD operations on your application data model. In the sample application, it demonstrates creating and retrieving blog posts.

To build, you will need Visual Studio 2013 or higher and Neo4j 2.x or higher. The library is built on the latest Neo4jClient which supports the newest Cypher syntax and building queries using Linq expressions.
